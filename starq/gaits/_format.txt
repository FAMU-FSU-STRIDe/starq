# FORMAT FOR GAIT FILE

# IMPORTANT: Do not include empty lines or comments (#) in the actual file

# FIRST SECTION: Gait Sequence
# Should range between 0-1000 milliseconds
# Should always include time 0 and 1000 as bounds
# Timing/frequency is adjusted by the velocity function
# Column 1: Time of stance in milliseconds
# Column 2: Stance for Leg 1 (FL)
# Column 3: Stance for Leg 2 (RL)
# Column 4: Stance for Leg 3 (RR)
# Column 5: Stance for Leg 4 (FR)

# EXAMPLE: Walking Gait
0000 1 1 1 1  # Full Support  (0 ms)
0450 1 0 1 0  # FL-RR Support (450 ms)
5000 1 1 1 1  # Full Support  (50 ms)
0950 0 1 0 1  # FR-RL Support (450 ms)
1000 1 1 1 1  # Full Support  (50 ms)

# Sections separated by dashed line (Amount doesn't matter)
---

# SECOND SECTION: Control Mode
# Can either be POSITION or VELOCITY
# If POSITION, the next two lines are the maximum linear and angular velocities
# If VELOCITY, there should be no additional lines

# Example:
POSITION
1.0 1.0 1.0  # Max linear velocity [m/s]
1.0 1.0 1.0  # Max angular velocity [rad/s]

---

# THIRD SECTION: MPC Weights
# Row 1: Position weights (x, y, z)
# Row 2: Orientaion weights (roll, pitch, yaw)
# Row 3: Linear velocity weights
# Row 4: Angular velocity weights
# Row 5: Force weights (fx, fy, fz)

# Example:
0.0 0.0 50.0     # Maintain Z height (Strong)
0.0 0.0 10.0     # Maintain yaw
10.0 10.0 10.0   # Maintain lin. velocity
10.0 10.0 10.0   # Maintain ang. velocity
1e-6 1e-6 1e-6   # Dampen control (Weak)
